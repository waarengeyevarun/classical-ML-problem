Building ML models to solve the underlying problems with the dataset

Building a model that can predict whether a patient (has) survived at 
least 2 years. 

Build another model using a different algorithm/approach to tackle the 
same problem. How does this algorithm/approach differ from your 
original model?

Compare the two models. Which one is better?

If given a new batch of unlabelled records, what is your estimate of the 
accuracy of the two models on this new set?

Apply the two models to `echocardiogram.test` and label that dataset.
